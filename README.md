# UFOs
## Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Creating filters will allow for an easy viewing HTML file with interactive user input. A webpage will be customized using Bootstrap with visuals and interactive table. The filters will allow UFO sightings to searched using different filters, such as location, date, and shape. The webpage will be called UFO Finder. 
## Results: 
Using UFO Finder, the user will be able to search the webpage based on when the sighting occurred, what city, state, and county the sighting occurred, and the shape of the UFO seen. Not only does the search bar give this information, but once a UFO sighting is searched, more information will be displayed. This information includes the duration (in minutes) of the sighting and also comments on the sighting itself. 
Under the filter search bar, you can make searches based on 5 different filters, these include: date, city, state, county, and shape. Here is what the filter will look like prior to a search:

As you can see, there are exmaples of different placeholders to show the user what type of input needs to be used to search for specific filter. 
Here is what happens when a filter is used, mo (Missouri) is searched in the "state" filter search: 
![MO filter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108147631/190278697-e7b50a3d-e1b1-442f-8c15-9e05c0106b4f.PNG)
The rest of the pade displays important information requested. An image was added behind the title for visual pleasure. The only other functional button on the screen is the "UFO Sightings" title. If that is clicked, then the page will be refreshed. 
## Summary: 
Overall, the project shows what we need but it could be improved. One drawback to this webpage design is that readablility is not designed as well as it could be. Two improvements that could be made include adding another filter for the duration column. For this, the raw data would have to be converted so that all values are just a number value without any text. If this was done, then a filter could be made. Another change that I would make is making the comment section easier to read. The comment section is scruntched on not very readable. As well as changing the font color on the Filter Search tabs. It is far too light to see in some spots. Colors could be altered.
